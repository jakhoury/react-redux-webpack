# react-redux-webpack
Conceptually simple, beautiful, and powerful JavaScript front-ends with React and Redux.

The purpose of this repo is to manage a front-end development project using React and Redux with help from WebPack for the build pipeline. This repo is focused primarily on these three technologies to minimize distractions and enable a more concise and elaborate exploration of React and Redux.Any additional packages are added as required, but it is the intention to minimize the dependency chain insofar as that is possible.
